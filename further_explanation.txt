This is a discrete event simulation tool for the Steps to Wellbeing Step 3 High Intensity Pathway.
The model simulates one year of activity (after a 2 year warm up period) and outputs wait time statistics for various treatment types.

The "total clients seen" section relates to patients who have finished waiting and started treatment (treatment could be completed or ongoing).
The "total clients waiting" section relates to patients currently on the wait list.
